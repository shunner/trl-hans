An improved (simplified) Chinese translation of [The Roots of Lisp](http://www.paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html) by Paul Graham, derived from [Dai Yuwen's work](http://daiyuwen.freeshell.org/gb/rol/roots_of_lisp.html).

## License and Copyright

As Paul said in [General FAQ](http://www.paulgraham.com/gfaq.html):
> Can I put a translation into another language online?
> 
> Sure. Please include the url of the original, and send me the url of your translation so I can make a link to it.

And Yuwen said in [Lisp](http://daiyuwen.freeshell.org/gb/lisp.html):
> 我把The roots of Lisp翻译成了中文 。 本文的 版权属于原著者Paul Graham。 
> 您还可以下载ps文档， dvi文档，或TeX源文档。 欢迎寄patch给我。

I've sent emails to inform Yuwen and Paul but get no response so far, so there won't be any license or copyright declarations by me.
